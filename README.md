# fivem-seatbelt
Developed last night on a live server. Hilarious AF so decided to share.  

Demo: https://gyazo.com/e04eb4641f0f3674912b2b6a1c4cba93

Launches player through the windshield if a huge change in velocity happens (eg. crash).  

Press K to enable / disable seatbelts.  
Edit Config.Strings to change language  

Note: You have to open your seatbelt to leave the vehicle.
